<h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
<p>Since childhood, I really wanted to visit the whole world, but did not have the opportunity. By the end of school, I was thinking more and more often about the most important questions in the life of every person:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>What do I like to do?</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>What can bring me income and development from this?</strong>
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Who do I want to be?</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>One day, I remembered the story of a civil pilot who laughed at a teacher’s remark in class: If you look out the window, you won’t make money. And now he is a pilot, an interesting profession, he flies all over the world, develops, and at the same time earns good money. It dawned on me that this is exactly what I want to do. But, unfortunately, I did not enter the University of Civil Aviation, so I decided through a difficult path …</p>
<p>I became a military pilot, learning English, taking courses on my vacations, and starting a long-term military discharge to become a civil aviation pilot. In June of this year, I retired from military service. However, due to the situation around the world, it is almost impossible to become a civil aviation pilot.During this short period I have been a manager since I am skilled in managing people and learning how to sell. In parallel, I bought and resold goods and explored other areas.</p>
<p>What brought me here? My childhood friend became a programmer 4 years ago, his wife became a programmer just recently. He told me a lot about this profession, but because of the small amount of knowledge about this profession, I thought that it was not for me. But his stories inspired me every time and destroyed my stereotype. I am very attracted to the activities of <span><strong>a product-manager and a project-manager</strong></span>, but it is not easy to become one. Since I want to create my own product and be a professional in my profession, I decided to start with the JavaScript / Front-end course.</p>
